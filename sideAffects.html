	<h3 class = "preStatement">What are the Side Affects of Main Character Syndrome?</h3>
	<p> If you or a love one is suffering from main character syndrom, here are some side affects to look out for. They may not show up all at once when affected, but rather can gradually manifest over time. The best way to prevent the syndrome from worsening is to get ahead of the problem.</p>	
<h3>Side Affects May Include...</h3>

</div>
<h2 class = "affectTitle"> Sense of Self-Importance</h2>
	<p class = "affectInfo">A side affect of MCS is a deep deep sense of self-importance. As a person becomes more and more engrossed in the online space and becoming an influencer, this sense of self importance grows immensely. More and more attention online correlates to more and more belief that everyone is obseesed with you, either in a good way or a bad way. This feeling may feel good in the moment, but your sense of reality is quickly slipping. </p>

</div>
	<h2 class = "affectTitle"> Constant Need for Social Media Engagement</h2>
		<p class = "affectInfo"> Another common side affect of MCS is a constant need for social media engagement. You are constantly fiending for people to perceive you online, whether that is through likes, views or hate posts. To many people with MCS any attention is good attention. Someone with MCS is also constantly posting online. Their surroundings become a content playground and they will do anything for a post or a branddeal, even if whatever they are promoting is complete sh*t.</p>

		<h2 class = "affectTitle">Dissonance Between Reality and the Online Space</h2>
			<p class = "affectInfo">The dangers of having an exaggerated sense of self-importance, coupled with an overreliance on social media engagement and a dissonance between online and real-life personas, are multifaceted and deeply concerning. When individuals prioritize their online presence over real-world interactions, they risk losing touch with the tangible, immediate world around them. This often leads to a lack of spatial awareness and an inadvertent inconvenience to others, as the virtual world takes precedence over the physical one.</p>

<h3> In extreme cases...</h3>

	<img src = "podcast.jpg" class = "affectImg"></img>
</div>
<h2 class = "affectTitle">Right Wing Radicalism</h2>
	<p class = "affectInfo"> In extreme cases, MCS can lead to right wing radicalism. As so called "alpha males" find access to podcast and bad takes, they realize they can garner attention from the internet in a negative way. This attention boost their ego as they think they are providing value to the world as people care about their "controversial" takes. If you know someone like this or you think you may be suffering from this side affects, remove or stay away from any microphone in a 100ft radius. </p>
