		<div>
		<h3 class = "preStatement"> Patient 0: Josh Harris</h3>
		<p class = "historyBlurb"> The earlist case of main character syndrome can be traced back to the 1990's and Josh Harris. Picture Harris, clad in the finest late-90s tech-entrepreneur garb (think turtlenecks and ill-fitting blazers), preaching the gospel of constant online presence. "Why live a life if you can't broadcast it?" he might have mused, gazing into a future where every meal, every outing, every mundane moment was a spectacle waiting to be shared with an audience of eager voyeurs.</p>

	<h2> An Analysis of Main Character Syndrome as Types</h2>

	<div class = "type2">
		<div class = "typeDiv">
			<h3 class = "types"> Type 1: Fitting In </h3>
			<p class = " typeInfo">The first type of main character syndorme is fitting =in. This type of people are those looking for a community online to like them or looking for virality. They have not yet reached this level of fame yet and live somewhat normal lives. In the photo we can see someone say "The nyc outfit videos are just more authentic featuring New Yorkers." This implies she sees those around her like props and accessories to her content. These type of people will post anything as long as they think it will make people around them engage with it. </p>

		<h3 class = "types"> TYPE 2: Money Hungry</h3>
		<p class = " typeInfo"> The second type of main character syndrome is those that are persuaded by the money. They will do anything and everything to make money, particuarly at the expense of themselves or others around them. This can be seen in the TikTok NPC live streams. In these lives, we see people following the views commands based off the items they are gifted. The viewers control the streamer and the streamer believes in their self-importance. </p>

			<h3 class = "types"> TYPE 3: The Influencer  </h3>
			<p class = " typeInfo">  The third type of main character syndrome is the influencer. This person has already reached internet fame and are quickly loosing touch with reality. They see every aspect of relity as a chance for content and have completely disassociated with the real world. In the photo we see the influencer affected by main character sundrome who says, "Just finished working, itâ€™s 5:19. Try being an influencer for a day. Try it... Every single day I get up at 6 A.M." She truly believes in ther best of heart, that being an influencer is one of the most difficult jobs in the world. She is too far gone. </p>

		<h3 class = "types"> TYPE 4: Pursuit of Control</h3>
		<p class = " typeInfo"> The fourth type of main character syndrome is someone who is on the pursit of control. This main character knows they already have influence on a large group of people and personfies a fake persona to control them. They will do or say anything to keep their fame, even if it means many people that them and they are spewing hateful ideology. Thier main audience is loyal to them and they are able to control what they believe and sell them anything. This makes the controller feel more power and make a LOT of money. Typically they're bald and ugly so I don't see the appeal.</p>

They say anything and everything they want to becauae they know there will be no repercusion. They enjoy seeing how the people react to thier wild statements as they enjoy the sadism of the world crumbling under them from their masions.  </p>
