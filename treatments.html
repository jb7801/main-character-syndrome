			<img src="onSocial.jpg" class = "treatImg">
			<p  class = "treatInfo"> In an age where the line between the digital and the real often blurs, a hilarious new movement has emerged, humorously reminding people to distinguish between online fantasy and offline reality. Dubbed 'Reality Check 101', this tongue-in-cheek campaign uses a series of mock-PSAs, viral memes, and witty slogans like 'Your Likes Don't Count in Real Votes' and 'No, You Can't Photoshop Your Face in Real Life'. They highlight the absurdity of mistaking social media popularity for real-world skills, like confusing Twitter debates for actual problem-solving or treating Instagram filters as legitimate beauty standards. The movement aims to gently nudge the digital generation back to a world where physical interactions matter and remind them that, despite the allure of the virtual realm, reality still rules supreme. Remember, folks: your online avatar doesn't need to eat, but you do</p>
